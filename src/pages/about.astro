                  <strong class="text-brand-charcoal">J&B McKinney Rental Properties, LLC</strong> was established in honor of the extraordinary couple, <strong class="text-brand-teal">James E. McKinney and Bobbye S. Ivery</strong>—the parents of our Founder and CEO, Deirdre McKinney Stokes, and the grandparents of our COO, Jonathan Dean Stokes.
                </p>

                <p>
                  James and Bobbye were both born and raised in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and came of age during the 1930s to 1950s. They met in the third grade and went on to graduate from Industrial High School, where <strong class="text-brand-gold">Bobbye was Valedictorian</strong> and <strong class="text-brand-gold">James ranked third in the class</strong>. Both pursued higher education at Alabama State College, earning bachelor's and master's degrees in education.
                </p>

                <p>
                  During their college years, financial hardship led James to work in the steel mills of Gary, Indiana—where his family had relocated during the Great Migration. Before he could return to school, he was drafted into the Korean War. He served his country honorably and, upon completing his military service, returned to college with support from the GI Bill. While James was away, Bobbye completed her degree and began her teaching career. The couple reunited, married, and soon welcomed their daughter, Deirdre Celeste McKinney.

            <p>
              As they built successful careers in education, James and Bobbye also turned their focus to creating long-term financial stability and generational wealth. They identified <strong class="text-brand-charcoal">real estate as the most dependable path forward</strong>. In 1965, they purchased their family home in Tuscaloosa, and in 1968, James acquired his childhood home and began renting it to tenants.
            </p>

            <p>
              That same year, both James and Bobbye were recruited to work in the Muskegon Heights Public School System in Michigan. With improved job opportunities and a shared vision, they began purchasing, renovating, and managing residential rental properties—<strong class="text-brand-teal">laying the foundation for what would eventually become J&B McKinney Rental Properties, LLC</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              After 60 years of marriage, James passed away in 2015. Now 93 years old, Bobbye often reflects on how their modest beginnings in real estate have blossomed into <strong class="text-brand-gold">a company dedicated to helping individuals and families access safe, affordable housing</strong>.
